# General Specifications
The objective of this project is to keep a copy of knowledge offline. It is also a goal to keep intelligence over that knowledge, and to ensure it is safe by backing out the information.

# Sources of Knowledge
There could be many sources of kwoledge and knowledge can be seen as something highly unstrucrtured and undefined. Given that, there will be an order of the knowledge assets get stored and that order is below in priotirty, the fist ones being the top priorities.

1. [Wikipedia](0020-Wikipedia.md)
1. Project Gutemberg

In order to be able to download, the sources must be free, legal, basically with the correct copyrights and fundametally accessible of line.
Each source that is offline can have its own tools to search andvizualize the knowledge, however we should have an entry point for all of them when looking for and searching for data.


## Artificial Intelligence
Ideally we should have an offline and free AI model that will be fully trained in that knowledge base

## Updates and Upgrades
The source of knowledge data and the AI Models are an ever evolving base and therefore need to be updated. Sometimes there are software and hardware involved and they might need to be upgraded as well.

Whenever possible we should automatically check for upgrade or knwoing a source updates the data periodically we should adjust to that and autmatically get a new view or version.

When updating is important that before we keep the current operation valid status in a workable condition, hence the need for back prior upgrades and updates

## Operations and Automation
Operationally the queries over the knowl.edge base should be web based whenver possible and then remotely runnable, meaning network access.
All operation, since back up and down load should be fully automated and based on seemless scripts. These scripts should be easilly and obvisouly accessible for inspection and potentially be trigger according an automated schedule
